# Relay Stations with 99G - Get the fastest path between two stations!

### This project was developed for the college unit Programming II using the DFS algorithm.

### Grade: not graded, got the deadline wrong by 1 hour :D

## Features:

- Search the fastest path between two stations
- Stations with 99G are 2 times faster than 98G
- Stations with 98G are 2 times faster than 97G
- Stations with 97G can only send and receive data from each other
- A 35 stations network that can be extended

## Technologies used:

- Python 3

## Side Notes:

To try this project use the _relayStations.txt_ file (or a costum stations network) and the _tests.txt_ (or a costum tests file). Both must be in the main directory. Then, run the following command:

    python relayStations.py <network_filename> <tests_filename> <results_filename>

for the results file, name it whatever you want!

Part of the code in this project was taken and tweaked from the Chapter 12 of the John Guttag, 2016 book, _Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python_ as the professor instructed.
